## Data Format

Timetable data is stored in text files in the `public/data/` directory. The naming convention is:

- English: `schedule-YY-bXX.txt` or `schedule-YY-mXX.txt`
- Russian: `ru-schedule-YY-bXX.txt` or `ru-schedule-YY-mXX.txt`

Where:
- `YY` is the last two digits of the enrollment year (e.g., 21 for 2021)
- `bXX` is the bachelor group number (e.g., b01)
- `mXX` is the master group number (e.g., m01)

Each file follows this format:
\`\`\`
Day of week|Start time|End time|Course name|Professor|Room|Class type|Date
\`\`\`

Example:
\`\`\`
Monday|09:00|10:30|Corporate Finance|John Smith|Room 123|Lecture|2023-09-01
